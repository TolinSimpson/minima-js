## USER STORIES
```
[US001] AS:[Frontend developer] WANT:[Create components with useState/useEffect] SO:[React-like development experience] PRI:[1] POINTS:[8]
AC: 1.useState returns [value, setter] 2.useEffect handles side effects 3.Component-local state prevents race conditions
DEV: [WeakMap-based component registry] TEST: [Hook state isolation tests]

[US002] AS:[Developer] WANT:[Write templates with html`<div>${value}</div>`] SO:[JSX-like syntax without compilation] PRI:[1] POINTS:[5]
AC: 1.Template literals work 2.Values are sanitized 3.No eval usage
DEV: [DOMParser-based template parsing] TEST: [XSS prevention tests]

[US003] AS:[Developer] WANT:[Form inputs to preserve state during re-renders] SO:[Better UX than React/Vue] PRI:[2] POINTS:[3]
AC: 1.Input values preserved 2.Focus maintained 3.Scroll position kept
DEV: [Surgical DOM updates] TEST: [Form state preservation tests]

[US004] AS:[Security engineer] WANT:[Zero eval usage and XSS protection] SO:[CSP-strict compliance] PRI:[1] POINTS:[13]
AC: 1.No eval anywhere 2.All inputs sanitized 3.CSP-strict compatible
DEV: [Comprehensive sanitization functions] TEST: [Security penetration tests]

[US005] AS:[Performance engineer] WANT:[<18KB total bundle size] SO:[Faster load times than competitors] PRI:[1] POINTS:[8]
AC: 1.Core 9KB 2.Full client 14KB 3.Complete SSR 18KB
DEV: [LRU caching, syntax compression] TEST: [Bundle size measurement]
```

## BUSINESS RULES
```
MultiModeArchitecture → CONDITION:[Developer chooses mode] ACTION:[Framework loads only needed features] EXCEPTION:[SSR requires all previous modes]
PRIORITY:[critical] OWNER:[framework-architect]

FormStatePreservation → CONDITION:[Component re-renders] ACTION:[Preserve input values, focus, scroll] EXCEPTION:[Type/tag changes require replacement]
PRIORITY:[high] OWNER:[ux-engineer]

TemplateSecurity → CONDITION:[User interpolates values] ACTION:[Sanitize all content automatically] EXCEPTION:[Trusted HTML explicitly marked]
PRIORITY:[critical] OWNER:[security-engineer]

BundleSizeLimits → CONDITION:[Adding features] ACTION:[Must stay within size targets] EXCEPTION:[Security algorithms may exceed for functionality]
PRIORITY:[high] OWNER:[performance-engineer]
```

## CONSTRAINTS
```
LEGAL:[None specific] TECH:[ES6+ browsers only, <18KB total bundle] BIZ:[7-day implementation timeline]
PERFORMANCE:[<16ms initial render, <8ms updates] CAPACITY:[Single-threaded browser main thread] SECURITY:[CSP-strict, no eval, comprehensive XSS protection]
```
